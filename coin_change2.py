518. Coin Change 2

You are given coins of different denominations and a total amount of money.
Write a function to compute the number of combinations that make up that amount.
You may assume that you have infinite number of each kind of coin.

Note: You can assume that

0 <= amount <= 5000
1 <= coin <= 5000
the number of coins is less than 500
the answer is guaranteed to fit into signed 32-bit integer
